The Problem
-----------

We have 12 teams; we play two games each night; we play on 4 diamonds; and thru out the season we will play each team twice; we play in 3 times slots each night; 6:30, 7:40, 8:50.

I have attached a copy of last yearâ€™s schedule. Plus I have attached how the teams sort out playing two early games, two late games and split; one early and one late.

Also we have one team that travels about 100 miles to play so they have requested all late games; team 6. We travel 40 miles, team 12. One other team travels 60 miles, team 5 and the rest are from Sioux Falls.

As you can see that we (team 12) played the most splits along with team 2, etc.

My question to you; is there a way to get the early, late and splits more even? Except team 6 who plays all late games???
