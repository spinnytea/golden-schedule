# Overview

I didn't come up with a brand new schedule.
But given last years schedule, I swapped the time slots of games across the weeks. (Given that team 6 can only have late games, this means I only swapped the late games). Using this method, this is the best I could come up with. With this method, I've dropped the max split games from 7 down to 5.

The schedule has some quirks, but maybe we can remap the teams to better suit the _personality_ of the schedule. For example, Team 6 requested all late games, so they'd cannot be swapped. Team 5 has to travel 60 miles, so we could give them the matchups that have no splits, so I also swapped the play times for Team 4 and Team 5.

# Metrics

Most teams have 5 splits, one team is blessed with 0 splits, and the remaining have 2 to 4.

Early and Late games are pretty evenly spread, but there are still outliers, especially for late games.

| Team  | Early | Late  | Split |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|  MAX  |    6  |    8  |    5  |
|    1  |    5  |    1  |    5  |
|    2  |    5  |    1  |    5  |
|    3  |    3  |    3  |    5  |
|    4  |    3  |    3  |    5  |
|    5  |    3  |    8  |    0  |
|    6  |    0  |   11  |    0  |
|    7  |    5  |    1  |    5  |
|    8  |    1  |    7  |    3  |
|    9  |    6  |    0  |    5  |
|   10  |    2  |    7  |    2  |
|   11  |    6  |    0  |    5  |
|   12  |    5  |    2  |    4  |
